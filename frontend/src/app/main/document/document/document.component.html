                        packages. If you access the website located at www.petcoset.com, or access any information, function, or service available or enabled by Petcoset(each, a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”), or complete the Petcoset account

                                Some browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. Because of differences in how browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of
